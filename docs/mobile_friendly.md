This is a checklist for making the html pages mobile friendly. Things should have less side padding and side margin so that they make use of the whole screen size. Also things should be finger friendly. When you are done with a page then check it off. Another reminder is that we want to keep the css in the `static/css` directory and not in the file itself and NEVER inline.
